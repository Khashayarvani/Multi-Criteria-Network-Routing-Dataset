This dataset, Multi-Criteria Network Routing Dataset, is designed for research and analysis of secure and reliable data transmission in distributed networks. It supports the development and evaluation of routing optimization algorithms by incorporating key factors such as latency, bandwidth, security risks, trust scores, and energy efficiency.

The dataset includes 500 simulated network routing records, where each route is evaluated based on its performance and security attributes. It features a target column (Optimal_Route) that labels each routing decision as either Optimal (1) or Non-Optimal (0) based on predefined criteria.

Key Features:
Route Characteristics: Source and destination nodes, latency, bandwidth.
Security Metrics: Security risk score and trust score.
Performance Indicators: Packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, energy consumption.
Target Column: Classifies routes as Optimal (1) or Non-Optimal (0) based on multi-criteria evaluation.
